# Mycalculator
here is the Basic Calculator program
Project Description:
The Calculator App is a basic graphical user interface (GUI) application developed using Python and the Tkinter library. It allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The app provides a user-friendly interface where users can input numbers and operations via buttons, similar to a physical calculator.

## Features:
User Interface: The app features a clear and simple interface with buttons for digits (0-9), decimal point, and basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).
Display: An entry widget at the top of the app shows the current input and results.
Real-time Calculations: Users can input expressions and get results instantly upon pressing the equals button.
Error Handling: The app catches errors such as division by zero and displays an error message.
## How It Works:
Display: The top of the app features a display (entry widget) that shows the input and output.
Buttons: The main body contains buttons for digits, operations, and a clear button.
Input Handling: Clicking a button updates the display with the corresponding value.
Calculation: When the equals button is pressed, the app evaluates the expression and updates the display with the result.
Clear Functionality: The clear button resets the display to an empty state.
## Technologies Used:
Python: The programming language used to develop the application.
Tkinter: The standard GUI library in Python used to create the application's interface.
This project is ideal for beginners looking to understand the basics of GUI development with Python and Tkinter. It demonstrates essential programming concepts such as event handling, layout management, and basic error handling in a simple and practical application.
